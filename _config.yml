summary: 'My research interest focuses on domain adaptation (transfer learning) and object tracking in computer vision. Currently, I am aiming at improving the performance of algorithms in different visual domains using transfer learning technologies to handle the basic problems of computer vision (target recognition, detection, tracking, etc.). I also focus on cutting-edge research in the field of image synthesis, including generative adversarial networks (GANs) and image style transfer. More research details, please refer to <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/mao-xiao-feng-29-7/activities">My Zhihu Link</a>.'
